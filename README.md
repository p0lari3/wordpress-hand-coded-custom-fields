This repo contains examples of hand coded custom fields.

These examples should be really handy if
* You only need one or two fields and you dont want to have to use a whole third party plugin for for that
* You need more advanced functionality then popular third party plugins provide
* You want to understand how these fields are created and not just blindly rely on third party software
